\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a resistive circuit has been
achieved. Analyses of current intensity in branches and nodal voltages have been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
precisely. 
The reasons for the match may be related to the fact that this is a
simple linear circuit, in which the currents and voltages do not vary with time, and
the components are considered to be ideal in both models. Furthermore, the mesh and 
nodal methods are systematic and structured. The theoretical and the Ngspice 
simulation models do not differ.
