\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

To accurately simulate the circuit in ngspice, precaution is needed with the positive and negative nodes associated with each component, since an error in these parameters would cause currents and voltage sources operating in the wrong direction.

It's important to add that due to a peculiarity of the program, we couldn't get the current in the resistance $R_5$ as a reference for the current dependent voltage source. To solve that, we created a
